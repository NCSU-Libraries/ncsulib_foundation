/* @file
 * This file is a custom file that loads all files. Each non-base layer
 * can be disabled.
 *
 * Do not name this file, "app.scss". If you run a compass update this file can
 * be wiped out with a compass update. By default, when a compass project is
 * created the file will be named app.scss. Thus this file is named,
 * THEMENAME.scss.
 *
 * This application file (THEMENAME.scss) is where all the partials are
 * imported.
 *
 * Theme styles are categorized using SMACSS standards. They utilize
 * categorization of styles into various categories. Those categories are the
 * following:
 *
 * - Base: CSS reset/normalize plus HTML element styling.
 * - Layout: Macro arrangement of a web page, including any grid systems.
 * - Component: Dictate minor layout modules or reusable elements.
 * - State: Describe the appearance of a module in various states.
 * - Theme: Purely visual optional styling (“look-and-feel”) for a component.
